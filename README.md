The notebook 'VQT Illustration.ipynb' illustrates the
Variational Quantum Thermalizer (VQT) algorithm:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02071.pdf for a 1D Heisenberg Chain.

The code in the corresponding source files is written from scratch in a modular manner, allowing for the easy addition of new classes.
